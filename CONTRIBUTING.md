## Making Changes
* Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work.
  * This is usually the master branch.
  * For ease of use, we recommend that you work on a branch other than master.
  * To quickly create a topic branch based on master; `git checkout -b contribution`
* Make changes and commit where necessary.
* Check for unnecessary whitespace with `git diff --check` before committing.
* If you're working in NetBeans, you can format your code easily by clicking "Source" -> "Format".
* Make sure your commit messages are in line with those which are already made.
* **Make sure your commit message closes the previously made issue. See [this blog post](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages).**

* If you want to add multiple changes, please make one pull request per change. This way, it's easier to accept your changes faster and won't block the other changes if there is an issue with a specific line of code.
